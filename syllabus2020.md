# Arch 741 Parametric Design
Instructor: Anthony Quivers
## Introduction
This summer session seminar is conceived to introduce students to parametric and numerical methods in the production of architectural drawings and instructions.  Emphasis will be placed on the processes and the exploitation of ordering principles.

Students will be introduced at depth to conveying subjective experience through architectural concepts and will be assessed on their ability to communicate plans at a level that indicates a paramentricly driven scheme.

Students will also explore exemplary precedents on parametric design and comprehensive system planning, as well as the architects whose work exhibit these qualities.  
## Format
Students will be executing an architectural design in a 5-week workshop based course.  Each week will have a lecture module, a desk crit and a presentation.  

Fieldwork and sketching technique will be essential in communicating as complex of a design as possible with minimal time and information.  Course work will have rich conceptual value and take advantage of reasonable approximations of site characteristics, and suspensions of reality.  
## Topics
Over the course of the session, through a carefully-choreographed sequence of assignments, students will engage these concepts multiple times and from different perspectives:

_Parametric Design (Process and Automation) which underlie architectural design processes_
_Architectural “precedent” and “typology”_
_Tectonic articulation; technical building requirements, including building systems_
