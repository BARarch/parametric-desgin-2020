The students will cut a plan for their parametric interventions.  Geometries will be created using processing and concepts will be explored through parametric design methods.  Students will refine the output from these scripted models and produce output in rapid fashion.

## Code Snippets for Plans
We will be using these in an abstract manner to help with agregating geoemtries without getting boged down with structuring code in a programming language.  The student shall make changes and infer the develoment of patterns from successive tweaks and modifications of these scripts.

## Class Work Session and Desk Crit
Today we will starting our large plans.  This will be one of the deliverables for the final.
For the moment I don't want you to worry about the strokes or even the fill.  I want to see you experiment with these algorithms, use variables, and get geometry on the pane.

Remeber to set you call set your size in the setup function -and have fun.

        def setup():
            size(800,800)
