# Arch 741 Parametric Design
Instructor: Anthony Quivers
## Introduction
This summer session seminar is conceived to introduce students to parametric and numerical methods in the production of architectural drawings and instructions.  Emphasis will be placed on the processes and the exploitation of ordering principles.

Students will be introduced at depth to conveying subjective experience through architectural concepts and will be assessed on their ability to communicate plans at a level that indicates a paramentricly driven scheme.

Students will also explore exemplary precedents on parametric design and comprehensive system planning, as well as the architects whose work exhibit these qualities.  

## Format
Students will be executing an architectural design in a 5-week workshop based course.  Each week will have a lecture module, a desk crit and a presentation.  

Fieldwork and sketching technique will be essential in communicating as complex of a design as possible with minimal time and information.  Course work will have rich conceptual value and take advantage of reasonable approximations of site characteristics, and suspensions of reality.  

## Topics
Over the course of the session, through a carefully-choreographed sequence of assignments, students will engage these concepts multiple times and from different perspectives:

_Parametric Design (Process and Automation) which underlie architectural design processes_
_Architectural “precedent” and “typology”_
_Tectonic articulation; technical building requirements, including building systems_

## Objectives
Upon completion of this course, the student should have demonstrated the following skills:

>Exploit a parametric of form, material or space to formulate an architectural design
>
>Use numerical and scripting tools to execute architectural drawings and artifacts.
>
>Convey a comprehensive plan using parametric tools and numerical methods

All assignments will require, in different ways, these skills and the concepts which support them. 

Students should refer to the Curriculum Matrix and NAAB Skill Requirement Chart for better awareness about the pedagogical goals of each curriculum component. The NAAB Student Performance Criteria which this course contributes to the M.Arch. curriculum are A.02 (Design Thinking Skills), A.05 (Investigative Skills), A.06 (Fundamental Design Skills), A.07 (Use of Precedents), and B.02 (Accessibility)

This semester’s studio will encourage both individual and group work at appropriate times to reflect the realities of professional practice, in which the management of architectural services often requires flexible means of realizing shifting goals.

## Git Repository
The students shall upload and share all grasshopper binaries using git.  It is a tool that offers a place for all grasshopper files to be stored, tracked and backed up if lost or errored. In this class, the students will be sharing these files to build a repository of grasshopper code, ensuring expedient progress in the seminar concepts.  Participation in the repository is mandatory.

## Projects
The work during this session will comprise two assignments and one design project.  Students will participate in two site visits, an analysis component and an architectural design.

The students will produce three artifacts in the execution of an architectural design, a generator pane, one plan drawing/with a section subset and one render.  All three artifacts will be 36” W by 36” L and will demonstrate numerical execution, and express phenomenological spacial effects.

## Attendance
***Attendance at each Studio class session, for its full duration, is required.***

Each student is expected to arrive at each Studio class session with new work for discussion with his or her Instructor. Due to the constraints of each student’s day-time schedule, however, it is imperative that productive work also occur in Studio, during class time. One or two unexcused absences will be factored with negative impact into the academic grade given for the course. Following the third unexcused absence, however, students will receive a letter “F” grade; alternatively, a student with three unexcused absences may withdraw voluntarily from the course (with consequences depending on the academic calendar). Significant lateness will be counted as an absence. 

Each class will start at its designated hour. One late arrival of more than ten minutes but less than twenty minutes is allowable without grading penalty per semester. Any subsequent lateness of more than ten minutes will be counted as an absence.

## Grading
In this course student work will be assessed on the following criteria:

Phenomenology: Expression of Concept

Parametricism: Efficiency and Effectiveness of Execution

Richness: Ambitiousness of Process

Calculation of Final grades will be based on aggregated assessments of assigned work produced throughout the session. These assessments will reflect objective/quantitative achievement AND the instructors’ professional judgments about design excellence, communicative and graphic quality, apparent effort, and relative skill level, depending upon the assignments. Since new graphic or model work is REQUIRED for each class, grades will reflect the presence (or lack) of consistent development from session to session.

Midterm and final Grades may be interpreted in the following way: 

	    A 	Exceeds Expectations 		(ie, exceptional work in both technique and concept)  
	    B 	Meets Expectations 		    (ie, complete, competent, and continually improving)  
	    C 	Does Not Meet Expectations 	(ie, partially incomplete, visually unsophisticated, and/or partially lacking technical competence)
	    F 	Unsatisfactory 			    (ie, incomplete, little or no progress shown, and/or fully lacking technical and visual competence)
