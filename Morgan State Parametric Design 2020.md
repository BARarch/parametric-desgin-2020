# Morgan State Parametric Design 2020

This is the course repository for the seminar studio. Here we will track and share all course related material and student work.

## 3D Files and Output

Create two new folders '3D' and 'output'. This should be the place for all 3D models and output files (png or vector) within the course folder. We will not be tracking these in this class so placing them within these folders allows the tracker to ignore them. So if you are using a rhino file to drive your grasshopper scripts anywhere within the gh-binary folder, even if it is within a folder inside the gh-binaries folder, please put them within the 3D folder.

## Tutorials

Grasshopper tutorials on various topics and features are listed in the 'tutorials.md' file
