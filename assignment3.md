If you do not have Python mode select
Add Mode->Python Mode for Processing 3...->Install.

Then when you are ready, press the play button on the upper left or ctrl-R to run the code.

A second window should appear with this:

roll your mouse from left to right over this window.  What do you think?

I want you to save this sketch in the "parametric-design-2020" folder on your computer so we can continue with this on Wednesday.  Call the sketch 'roundedRectSnippet'.
