# Assignment 2: Getting started with GitHub and Python
For this assignment the students will get a feel for the flow of software production and post to the class repository.  

### Accept the invitation
Each student will have the ability to sumbit their solutions to the class repository.  Check your email for an invitation from GitHub and accept this invitation.

### Install Microsoft Studio Code
Microsoft studio is a code editor you can use to edit files outside of processing. 
goto https://code.visualstudio.com/ in order to download and install.

Open code from the git Bash window by typing

        $code .   

### Changing a File
When opening the editor in the class folder you will see all of the files inside the folder on the side panel on the left.

Open _hello.py_ and change the word _World_ in "Hello World" on line 5 to your name and Save this file.

### Commit and Push to the Repository
Goto the git bash window and type

        $git commit -a -m "first commit"

This commits the changes you made to your file.  You can now submit your code by pushing the code to your branch of the repository.  *Remember the name of your branch is your first name*

        $git push origin [branch-name]

This is how work will be submitted for the remainder this seminar.  I will be checking your sumbissions on the repository on-line.
